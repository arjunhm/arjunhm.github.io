A slotted page structure typically includes:</p>\n<p><strong>Page Header</strong>: Contains metadata such as the number of records, free space offset, and a pointer to the slot directory.<br>\n<strong>Slot Directory</strong>: An array of pointers, each pointing to the location of a record within the page. Slots can be reused when records are deleted.<br>\n<strong>Data Area</strong>: The actual storage space for records, which can vary in size. Records are packed together to minimize fragmentation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slotted Pages","date":"2024-05-23T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2024-05-23-slotted-pages/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
